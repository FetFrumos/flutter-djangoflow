## Architectural Overview of `djangoflow_openapi`

The `djangoflow_openapi` package serves as a foundational bridge between our Django backend and Flutter frontend applications. This architecture is designed to streamline the development process, ensuring that our Flutter apps can communicate efficiently and securely with our Django services.

### Purpose and Design

The primary purpose of `djangoflow_openapi` is to automatically generate Dart models and API client methods from the OpenAPI schemas provided by our Django backend modules. This automated generation ensures that our frontend and backend are always in sync, reducing the potential for errors and mismatches in data structures or API endpoints.

### Workflow

1. **OpenAPI Schema Generation**: Each Django module generates an OpenAPI schema, detailing all available endpoints, request bodies, and response structures.
2. **Compilation into `djangoflow_openapi`**: These schemas are then compiled into the `djangoflow_openapi` package. This process transforms the OpenAPI specifications into Dart code, creating models and API methods that our Flutter applications can use directly.
3. **Distribution**: The compiled `djangoflow_openapi` package is hosted on pub.dev, making it accessible for inclusion in Flutter projects.

## Using Local `djangoflow_openapi` in Flutter Projects

While the remote `djangoflow_openapi` package provides a solid base for most projects, there are scenarios where project-specific customizations to the Django backend necessitate updates to the Flutter-Django communication layer. In these cases, a local version of `djangoflow_openapi` is generated to include these customizations.

### Integrating with Flutter Projects

To use the locally generated `djangoflow_openapi` package in a Flutter project, perform the following steps:

1. **Local Package Reference**: Modify your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` to reference the local version of `djangoflow_openapi`. This is done by specifying the path to the local package instead of using the version hosted on pub.dev.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     djangoflow_openapi:
       path: /path/to/your/local/djangoflow_openapi
   ```

2. **Fetch Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` to ensure your project recognizes and uses the local version of the package.

3. **Development Continuation**: Continue development as usual, with your Flutter app now using the updated API methods and models that reflect your backend changes.

### Benefits

- **Customization**: Allows for project-specific customizations to be rapidly integrated into your Flutter app.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures that your frontend and backend remain in sync, even when temporary or project-specific backend changes are made.
