## Melos Commit Patterns

[Melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos) uses the following commit patterns to manage the versioning of your monorepo:

- `feat`: Introduces a new feature.
- `fix`: Fixes a bug.
- `docs`: Updates the documentation.
- `style`: Code style changes (no functionality changes).
- `refactor`: Refactors the code.
- `test`: Adds or updates tests.
- `chore`: Routine tasks, maintenance etc.
- `revert¬†`: A change that reverts a previous commit.
- `perf`: A change that improves performance.

Example commit messages:

```
feat(auth): add user registration
fix(auth, ui): resolve layout issue on smaller screens
docs(analytics): update contribution guidelines
```

When you commit changes to the repository following these types of commit patterns, Melos will automatically generate changelogs and bump the version of the affected packages.

Here are some additional tips for contributing to your monorepo:

- Make sure your changes are well-tested.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the coding style of the project.
- Be respectful and polite in your interactions with other contributors.
